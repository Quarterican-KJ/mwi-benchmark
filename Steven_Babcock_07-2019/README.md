### Communication


Hello, {Insert client name}
My name is Steven Babcock and i am reaching out to you today from Midwestern Interactive to request some further information to use as content for your web application. Specifically I am looking for a few paragraphs and photos for the "About us" page. If you have a company mission statement I would love to include that for you. 
For the photos we would be looking for anything that captures the essence of your brand, as a marketing firm I am sure you have that covered.
Feel free to contact me with any specific questions you may have in regards to the content needed, the more information I can get, the better we will be.
Thank You for your help and have a wonderful rest of your day.
Steven Babcock

### Code Test

Any details you'd like to mention about your code test.

This was my first time playing with PHP and i was unsure how to test if a email would send, from my brief understanding it looks as if you cannot use a gmail based email address so I included ryans email address. If there was something that I could have done better I would like to know, afterall I applied for the chance to learn from people smarter than myself.
